    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        I was born in Oklahoma City and raised in Holcomb, Kansas. A majority of my younger years was spent working on my uncles' farm. These early mornings and late nights full of manual labor instilled a work ethic in me that I believe sets me apart from other people my age. Hard work is something I've known my whole life. I also picked up basketball in my youth, which I still play today. I attend Cornell University majoring in Information Science with a 3.0 GPA. I am a varsity basketball player for Cornell. Balancing school and athletics is also an attribute to my work ethic.
