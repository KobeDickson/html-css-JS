# Project 2: Design Journey

**For each milestone, complete only the sections that are labeled with that milestone.**

Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.

**Everything, including images, must be visible in Markdown Preview.** If it's not visible in Markdown Preview, then we won't grade it. We won't give you partial credit either. This is your warning.


## Design Planning

**Make the case for your decisions using concepts from class, as well as other design principles, theories, examples, and cases from outside of class.**

You can use bullet points and lists, or full paragraphs, or a combo, whichever is appropriate. The writing should be solid draft quality but doesn't have to be fancy.

### Audience (Milestone 1)
> Briefly explain who the intended audience(s) is for your website. Be specific and justify why this audience is appropriate for your site. Remember, you may not be the audience.

The intended audience for my site are parents of students and potential visitors that come to Ithaca to visit their friends. This is appropriate because these would be the two groups to not know much about the Apple Harvest Festival in the first place.


### Semi-Structured Interview Questions (Milestone 1)
> Plan your semi-structured interview which you'll use to identify the needs of your users. You are required to have a minimum of 4 questions.

1. Recall your last festival you attended, what was your experience like?
2. What are some similarities shared between festivals you have attended?
3. Tell me what you know about the Apple Harvest Festival.
4. What is the connection between a festival's quality and the kind of stands there?


### Interview Notes (Milestone 1)
> Interview at least 2 people from your audience. Take notes and include those notes here. Make sure to include a brief description of each interviewee.

Interviewee 1: Joe Samberg

TODO: Housemate's dad
TODO: Last festival was a "blast." All his favorite food had great food and entertainment. Knew a little bit from his son talking about it. Said his favorite festivals always have the best food.

Interviewee 2: Chris Nemechek

TODO: Friend from home that plans to visit me next year.
TODO: He described his last festival experience as fantastic. He said that all of the festivals he went to had really great websites that detailed what stands were available and when he would be able to attend. Knew nothing about Apple Harvest Festival. His favorite things at festivals were the food and souvenir stands.


### Needs (Milestone 1)
> Analyze your audience's needs and wants from your notes above. List each need/want below. There is no specific number of needs required for this, but you need enough to do the job.

Need/Want 1: Background: [Brief Title]
- **Needs and Wants** _What does your client and audience need and want?_
  - My audience needs information on what the Apple Harvest Festival is and what it's all about.
- **Design Ideas and Choices** _How will you meet those needs and wants?_
  - I will meet these needs by dedicating a page to talking what Apple Fest is and how it came about.
- **Rationale & Additional Notes** _Justify your decisions; additional notes._
  - N/A

Need/Want 2: List of food stands
My audience seemed to emphasize how important food stands were to them so I will dedicate a page highlighting what selections are available at Apple Harvest Festival.

Need/Want 3: Activities/Entertainment
My audience also said that there were fun activities and great entertainment, so I will make a page highlighting past activities and entertainment available.


### Initial Design (Milestone 1)
> Document your design process. Show us your card sorting. Describe your theme. Show us sketches of your site (mobile and desktop versions). etc. You should show us how your came up with your design and how your iterated on that design; show us the evolution of your design.

For my theme, I am thinking about choosing fall colors. I think a yellowish background with red accents will be reminiscient of fall. I attached my design below. I came up with my design by tring to find something that was visually appealing and easy to access. On both of my sketches all of the links to other pages are right there in front of the potential user.

<img src="sketchp2.JPEG"
 alt="First Design Sketch"/>

## Design

### Final Design (Milestone 2)
> Include the final sketches for each of your pages.

**Desktop Design:**
<img src="Designs.jpg" alt="My mobile and desktop designs">

**Mobile Design:**
See above for my mobile designs


### Design Rationale (Milestone 2)
> Explain why your design is appropriate for your audience. Specially, why does your content organization, navigation, and site design/layout meet the needs of your users?

My design is appropriate because it is incorporates everything asked for in my surveying. My content organization is viewable and I give descriptions of what each page holds. Navigation is good because you are able to reach any of the other 3 pages from the page you are currently on. The site design and layout are aesthetically pleasing and does not get in the way of the content I am trying to put forth.


### Responsive Design Considerations (Milestone 2)
> Explain how you adapted your design to be responsive (support both mobile and desktop versions).

My content moves with the screen and my images stay proportionate to the screen. So even on mobile devices you will be able to read and see everything.


### Coded Draft Desktop Website (Milestone 2)
> Include screenshots of the draft version of your desktop design AND your mobile design. Include a screenshot for every page. If you're using Firefox, click the 3 dot button in the address bar and select "Take a Screenshot."

**Desktop Screenshots:**
<img src="desktop-home.png" alt="Desktop home page screenshot">
<img src="desktop-about.png" alt="Desktop about page screenshot">
<img src="desktop-stands.png" alt="Desktop stands page screenshot">
<img src="desktop-act.png" alt="Desktop activities page screenshot">

**Mobile Screenshots:**

<img src="mobile-stands.png" alt="Desktop stands page screenshot">
<img src="mobile-act.png" alt="Desktop activities page screenshot">



## User Testing (Round 1)

### User Testing Plan (Milestone 3)
> Plan out your user testing tasks before doing your user testing. These must be actual user testing tasks. **Tasks are not questions!**

1. Find where the craft show is and what might be there.

2. Identify activities that could be offered at the Apple Harvest Festival.

3. Find the general time of the year when the Apple Harvest Festival occurs.


### User 1 - Testing Notes (Milestone 3)
> When conducting user testing, you should take notes during the test. Place your notes here.

User immediately clicked stands without scrolling down the main page. Found the map and completed task 1. From stands page, the user clicked on activities tab. Read through the page and completed task 2. User went back to home page. Read everything on there. Clicked through other 3 pages reading them all. Could not find any information about when Apple Harvest Festival occurs.


### User 1 (Milestone 3)
> Using your notes from above, describe your user by answering the questions below.

1. Who is your user, e.g., where does the user come from, what is the user's job, characteristics, etc.?

Jake Kuhn-Bethesda, MD-Intern at LemonPerfect-Tall, mild demeanor, obsessed with fashion.


2. Does the user belong to your audience of the site? (Yes / No)
> If “No”, what’s your strategy of associating the user test results to your audience’s needs and wants? How can your re-design choices based on the user tests make a better fit for the audience?

Not fully a part of my audience as he went to Cornell, and is not enrolled at the moment, but would come back for something like Apple Fest. He has an eye for design and his feedback would be very useful in my first steps of re-design.



### User 1 (Milestone 3)

### Changes Based on User Testing (Final Submission
> What changes did you make to your design based on user testing?

My two users this round did not provide me with any feedback about changing the design of my site.


## Self-Reflection (Final Submission)
> This was the first project in this class where you were able to follow a user-centered design process from start to finish. What did you learn from this experience?

I learned that users play a big part in developing a website. Users can notice things that a developer would miss. User-centered design helps in making the website as accessible as possible.


> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments!

I have learned quite a bit since I started this class. Coming in, I knew a bit about html but not a lot. I could barely code a webpage. Now I am making multi-page websites and styling them with CSS. This class has been a blast to be a part of and I can't wait to see what's up next.
